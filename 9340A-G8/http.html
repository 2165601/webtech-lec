			<p>- Computer Scientist</p>
			<p>- Is the inventor of the World Wide Web and he created a new computer 
			language called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 
			which most web pages are written in. The first 
			web page was available on 6 August 1991.</p>
			<p>- Berners-Lee now leads the World Wide Web Consortium. 
			That is an organization that looks after the World Wide Web. 
			He is the author of the book Weaving the Web. He is a 
			director of The Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI), 
			and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for 
			Collective Intelligence. In April 2009, he was elected as 
			a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, 
			based in Washington, D.C. In 1999, Time Magazine named 
			Berners-Lee one of the 100 Most Important People of the 
			20th Century. In March 2000 he was awarded an honorary 
			degree from the Open University as Doctor of the University.</p>
			<p>- Invented it at CERN in 1989, jointly developed by the W3C and IETF.</p>

	  <h1> HTTP Resource Addressing </h1>
	  <div class="box1">
	  <h3>Scheme</h3>
	  <p>• Consisting of a sequence of characters beginning with a letter and followed by any combination of letters, digits, plus (+), period (.), or hyphen (-). Although schemes are case-insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters. It is followed by a colon (:). </p>
	  <h3>Autority</h3>
	  <p>• An authority part which consist of an optional authentication section of a user name and password, separated by a colon, followed by an at symbol (@). However this has already been deprecated.</p>
	  <h3>Host</h3>
	  <p>• Domain name (resolve to an IP address using DNS) of the server where the resource resides or will be created.</p>
	  <h3>Port</h3>
	  <p>• An endpoint of communication in an operating system. Default port of HTTP is 80 and HTTPS is 443.</p>
	  <h3>Path</h3>
	  <p>• Path, which contains data, usually organized in hierarchical form, that appears as a sequence of segments separated by slashes. Such a sequence may resemble or map exactly to a file system path, but does not always imply a relation to one.</p>
	  <h3>Query</h3>
	  <p>• An optional query, separated from the preceding part by a question mark (?), containing a query string of non-hierarchical data. Typically provided as key value pairs with ampresand ('&') separators between key value pairs.</p>
	  <h3>Fragment Identifier</h3>
	  <p>• An optional fragment, separated from the preceding part by a hash (#) and is identified by a key</p>

	  <p>• asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body.</p>
	  <h3>POST</h3>
	  <p>• used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.</p>
	  <h3>PUT</h3>

	  <h3>DELETE</h3>
	  <p>• deletes the specified resource.</p>

	  <h3>IF-MODIFIED-SINCE</h3>
	  <p>• used with a method to make it conditional: if the requested variant has not been modified since the time specified in this field, an entity will not be returned from the server; instead, a 304 (not modified) response will be returned without any message-body.</p>
	  <h3>IF-NONE-MATCH</h3>
	  <p>• used with a method to make it conditional.</p>

	  <h3>CONTENT-LOCATION</h3>
	  <p>• may be used to supply the resource location for the entity enclosed in the message when that entity is accessible from a location separate from the requested resource's URI.</p>
	  <h3>CONTENT-MID5</h3>
	  <p>• is an MD5 digest of the entity-body for the purpose of providing an end-to-end message integrity check (MIC) of the entity-body.</p>
	  <h3>CONTENT-RANGE</h3>
	  <p>• is sent with a partial entity-body to specify where in the full entity-body the partial body should be applied.</p>
	  <h3>CONTENT-TYPE</h3>
	  <p>• indicates the media type of the entity-body sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the media type that would have been sent had the request been a GET.</p>
