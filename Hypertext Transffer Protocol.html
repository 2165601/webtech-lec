                        <h2> HTTP Fundamentals </h2>

                          <h5>HTTP runs on top of TCP/IP</h5>  

                        <p>
                            <p>Using TCP port 80 by default or TCP port 443 for HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) </p>
                            <p>IANA, ICANN</p>
                        </p>

                          <h5>HTTP is based on a client server architecture</h5>  

                        <p>
                            <p>Client (aka User Agents) i.e., web browsers, web crawlers, and other end user tools and applications</p>
                            <p>Servers i.e., origin servers, proxy servers, gateway</p>
                        </p>

                          <h5>HTTP uses a request-response standard protocol</h5>  

                        <p>
                            <p>The client sends an HTTP request message to the server</p>
                            <p>The server processes the request and replies with an HTTP response message</p>
                        </p>

                          <h5>HTTP is a stateless communications protocol</h5>  

                        <p>
                            <p>Servers do not keep information about client in between requests</p>
                            <p>Serve and Forget</p>
                        </p>    

                          <h5>HTTP provides aupport for other funtionalities</h5>  
                            
                        <p>

							Consisting of a sequence of characters beginning with a letter and followed by any combination of letters, digits, plus (+), period (.), or hyphen (-). Although schemes are case-insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters. It is followed by a colon (:).
							</p>

                           	<p>An authority part which consist of an optional authentication section of a user name and password, separated by a colon, followed by an at symbol (@). However this has already been deprecated.

                        </p>
                          <h6>Path</h6>  
                           	<p>Path, which contains data, usually organized in hierarchical form, that appears as a sequence of segments separated by slashes. Such a sequence may resemble or map exactly to a file system path, but does not always imply a relation to one.
                        </p>
                          <h6>Query</h6>  
                           	<p>An optional query, separated from the preceding part by a question mark (?), containing a query string of non-hierarchical data. Typically provided as key value pairs with ampresand ('&') separators between key value pairs. 
                        </p>
                          <h6>Fragment Identifier</h6>  
                           	<p>An optional fragment, separated from the preceding part by a hash (#) and is identified by a key
