      <h1>History of World Wide Web</h1>
	  <img src="www.png" alt="World Wide Web">
	  <br><br>
	  <div class="box1">
	  <p>The World Wide Web ("WWW" or simply the "Web") is a global information medium which users can read and write via 
	  computers connected to the Internet. The term is often mistakenly used as a synonym for the Internet itself, but the 
	  Web is a service that operates over the Internet, just as e-mail also does. The history of the Internet dates back 
	  significantly further than that of the World Wide Web.web is the global information system.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h2>In the Beginning..</h2>
	  <p>Ideas for the World Wide Web date back to as early as 1946 when Murray Leinster wrote a short story which 
	  described how computers (that he referred to as 'Logics') lived in every home, with each one having access 
	  to a central device where they could retrieve information. Although the story does have several differences 
	  to the way the web works today, it does capture the idea of a huge information network available to everyone in their homes.</p>
	  <p>The real vision and execution for the World Wide Web didn't come about until around 40 years later in 1980 when an English chap 
	  by the name of Tim Berners Lee was working on a project known as 'Enquire'. Enquire was a simple database of people 
	  and software who were working at the same place as Berners Lee. It was during this project that he experimented 
	  with hypertext. Hypertext is text that can be displayed on devices which utilize hyperlinks. The Berners Lee Enquire 
	  system used hyperlinks on each page of the database, each page referencing other relevant pages within the system.</p>
      <p>Tim Berners Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
	  Berners Lee was a physicist and in his need to share information with other physicists around the world 
	  found out that there was no quick and easy solution for doing so. With this in mind, in 1989 he set about 
	  putting a proposal together for a centralized database which contained links to other documents. This would 
	  have been the perfect solution for Tim and his colleagues, but it turned out nobody was interested in it 
	  and nobody took any notice - except for one person. Tim's boss liked his idea and encouraged him to implement 
	  it in their next project. This new system was given a few different names such as TIM (The Information Mine) 
	  which was turned down as it abbreviated Tim's initials. After a few suggestions, there was only one name that 
	  stuck; the World Wide Web.</p>

	  <!-- Content for Browsers-->
      <h1>The First Browsers</h1>
	  <div class="box1">
      <p>By December 1990 Tim had joined forces with another physicist Robert Cailliau who rewrote Tim's original 
	  proposal. It was their vision to combine hypertext with the internet to create web pages, but no one at that 
	  time could appreciate how successful this idea could be.</p>
      <p>Despite little interest, Berners Lee continued to develop three major components for the web; HTTP, HTML 
	  and the world first web browser. Funnily enough, this browser was also called "the World Wide Web" and it 
	  also doubled as an editor.</p>
	  <p><h3>Line Mode Browser</h3> - feb 1992. This was also brought to us by Berners Lee. It was the first browser to 
	  support multiple platforms.</p>
	  <p><h3>Viola WWW Browser released</h3> - march 1992. This is widely suggested to be the world's first popular browser. 
	  It brought with it a stylesheet and scripting language, long before JavaScript and CSS.</p>
	  <p><h3>Mosaic Browser released</h3> - Jan 5th 1993. Mosaic was really highly rated when it first came out. 
	  It was developed at University of Illinois.</p>

	  <div class="content">
	  <h2>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h2>
	  <p>Although other protocols can be used such as FTP, this is 
	  the most common protocol. It was developed specifically for 
	  the World Wide Web and favored for its simplicity and speed.
	  This protocol requests the 'HTML' document from the server 
	  and serves it to the browser.</p>

	  <h2>Uniform Resource Locator</h2>
	  <p>The last part of the puzzle required to allow the web 
	  to work is a URL. This is the address which indicates 
	  where any given document lives on the web. It can be 
	  defined as <protocol>://<node>/<location></p>
